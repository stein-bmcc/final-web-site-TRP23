        <h1>Why I love the Ocean Animals</h1>
       
    </main>
        <p>Ever since I was a child, Whenever I went to the beach , I'm so curious about how the ocean animals live in the depth of these ocean. From tiny seahorses to giant whales, Ocean animals come in endless shapes, sizes and colors. But whales are my favorite ocean animal. Every time I hear a  distant whale song in a nature documentary , it's like hearing an old friend calling out from far away, reminding me to look deeper, to listen more closely and to never lose my sense of wonder. That's why I love whales. They remind me that the world is bigger, more mysterious and more beautiful than I'll ever fully understand. Ocean animals have freedom to explore the deep blue inspires me to embrace adventure and curiosity.</p>
