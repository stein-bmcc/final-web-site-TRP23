        <h>Happy Dolphin</h>
        <p>Dolphins have captivated my heart for as long as I can remember. Their playfulness and gentle nature make them truly remarkable creatures. Dolphins are known to be one of the smartest animals on Earth,and capable of problem-solving.Another quality I admire about dolphins is their playful spirit. My admiration for dolphins grows every time I see their bodies through the water, a perfect harmony of power and peace.</p>
